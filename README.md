# Tetris DFA in pure HTML

In order to reduce amount of states, a lot of things have been cut out, and field size reduced.
But it is theroticly possible to simulate all that funcitonality with finate amount of states, though computational resources required are beyond anything possible.
An exception would probably only be simulating randomness, which is imposible.

## Run
```console
docker compose up -d
```
